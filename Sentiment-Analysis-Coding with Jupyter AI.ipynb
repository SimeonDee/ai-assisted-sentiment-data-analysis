      "\n",
      "- **Poor Quality / Durability**\n",

      "  - Descriptions such as \"cheaply made\", \"feels like it will break any moment\", and \"terrible quality\" are frequent.\n",
      "  - Appears **frequently** in negative reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Misleading Product Description / Photos**\n",
      "  - Several reviews mention that the product did not match the photos or descriptions online (\"not what I ordered\", \"looks nothing like the photos\", \"misleading\").\n",
      "  - Complaints about false or exaggerated product claims.\n",
      "  - Mentioned **occasionally to frequently**.\n",
      "\n",

      "  - Appears **occasionally**.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Minor Design Flaws / User Experience Issues**\n",
      "  - A few customers noted minor problems with the design or instructions (\"minor design flaw\", \"instructions could be clearer\", \"small learning curve\").\n",
      "  - These generally did not overshadow overall satisfaction.\n",
      "  - Mentioned **occasionally**.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Price Concerns**\n",
      "  - Some reviews mention the price does not justify the quality or features.\n",
      "  - Comments like \"not worth the price\", \"good for the price point but others cost more\".\n",
